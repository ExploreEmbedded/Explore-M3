Explore M3 is a feature rich ARM Cortex M3 development board. *It can help you prototype ideas faster with Arduino and take them beyond, with bare metal programming, RTOS support and lower power modes if need be.*
We are writing numerous tutorials for programming with Arduino, Bare-Metal and RTOS. Explore M3 will also have a SWD Open Source Debugger(SODA), One Base, a quick prototyping baseboard with numerous peripherals and a  ARM Cortex M3 Starter kit.
