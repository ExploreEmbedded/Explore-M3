 * File:   delay.c
 * Version: 15.0
 * Author: ExploreEmbedded
 * Website: http://www.exploreembedded.com/wiki
 * Description: Contains the library function for delay.
 
The libraries have been tested on ExploreEmbedded development boards. We strongly believe that the 
library works on any of development boards for respective controllers. However, ExploreEmbedded 
disclaims any kind of hardware failure resulting out of usage of libraries, directly or indirectly.
